# benchtools

Are you a wet-lab scientist that finds yourself doing the same rote analysis on similar datasets over and over again for hours on end? 
You'd like to automate some of your analysis workflows, but you're a specialist in wet-lab experimentation, not scripting. That's what
**benchtools** is made for! The goal of this library is to automate many of the most common and time-consuming analysis tasks that bench 
scientists face so that you can focus on learning and designing better experiments! In contrast to many programming spaces, this repository 
is built with such coding beginners in mind. Welcome!
