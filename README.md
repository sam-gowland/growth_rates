# growth_rates

This repo is for quickly determining bacterial growth rates from plate reader OD600 data. It uses the iPython (Jupyter Notebooks) environment to import raw plate reader data from an Excel export, find a best-fit linear regression to Time (x) v. ln(OD600) (y) data, quality check fits, and export fit parameters back to Excel for easy end-user data manipulation and visualization.


## Scientific background
Bacteria and other microorganisms grown in liquid culture is typically modeled in four sequential phases: (1) lag phase, where microbes are acclimated to being introduced to a new environment and therefore do not grow quickly, (2) exponential phase, where the microbial population undergoes rapid expansion limiting only by the organism's growth rate, (3) stationary phase, where the culture is now so dense that microbes must compete for limited resources and slow their growth to increase long-term chances of survival, and (4) death phase, where nutrients are depleted to the point that the culture experiences a large-scale die-off.

Of these four phases, we are most often interested in modeling exponential phase, as this can provide insight into the organism's fitness under given culture conditions with no other competing factors.

Shown in the image below you can see the first three phases of the growth of bacteria in liquid culture: exponential phase has been modeled by a black curve superimposed on the blue raw data values, with lag phase preceding and stationary phase following exponential phase.

This image was generated by this code, and demonstrates its primary purpose: to identify the window of data that best fits an exponential curve, then provide these fit parameters back to the user for further analysis.
